# School_District_Analysis

Data analysis of school district, coding in Python

## Overview of Project

Using CSV files provided by the district, an analysis was performed to track school performance based on school budget and per capita budget as well as reading and math scores. Due to evidence of academic dishonesty, the analysis was reconfigured, and 9th grade scores have been omitted from both reading and math categories.
